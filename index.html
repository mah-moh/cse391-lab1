              I am a hard-working and driven individual who isn't afraid to face a challenge. 
              I'm passionate about my work and I know how to get the job done. 
              I would describe myself as an open and honest person who doesn't believe in misleading other people and tries to be fair in everything I do.

              I am an avid photographer. I picked up this hobby only a couple of years ago, so its relatively fresh. 
              Besides photography, I am educating myself on the basics of graphic design and editing.

              Composing music and songwriting also have been my favourite pastime since I was in high school. 
              I take pleasure in listening to music. I never really thought that this was my hobby, but Im beginning to comprehend that it is.
              I also like attending music concerts.
